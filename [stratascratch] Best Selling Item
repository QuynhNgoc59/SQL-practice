==> My approach:
WITH TotalPaid AS (
SELECT MONTH(invoicedate) AS month 
     , stockcode
     , description
     , SUM(unitprice*quantity) AS total_paid 
FROM online_retail
GROUP BY MONTH(invoicedate)
       , stockcode
       , description
)
, MaxRevenue AS (
SELECT month
     , MAX(total_paid) AS total_paid
FROM TotalPaid
GROUP BY month
)
SELECT m.month  
     , t.description
     , m.total_paid
FROM MaxRevenue AS m 
JOIN TotalPaid AS t
ON m.month = t.month
   AND m.total_paid = t.total_paid;
