Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.
As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

employee Schema:
column_name	type	description
employee_id	integer	The unique ID of the employee.
name	string	The name of the employee.
salary	integer	The salary of the employee.
department_id	integer	The department ID of the employee.
manager_id	integer	The manager ID of the employee.

==> My approach:
SELECT e1.employee_id
     , e1.name AS employee_name
FROM employee AS e1
JOIN employee AS e2 
ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
