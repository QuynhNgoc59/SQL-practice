Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card, and to gain some insights, you're analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.
Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of issued cards between the month with the highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance. Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

monthly_cards_issued Table:
Column Name	Type
card_name	string
issued_amount	integer
issue_month	integer
issue_year	integer

==> My approach:
--Min & max amt per card
WITH min_max_amt AS (
SELECT card_name
     , MIN(issued_amount) AS min_amt
     , MAX(issued_amount) AS max_amt
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name
)
--Difference between min & max amt  
SELECT card_name
     , max_amt - min_amt AS difference
FROM min_max_amt
ORDER BY difference DESC;
