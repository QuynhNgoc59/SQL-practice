UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.
Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are classified into various categories, but some calls cannot be neatly categorised. These uncategorised calls are labeled as “n/a”, or are left empty when the support agent does not enter anything into the call category field.
Write a query to calculate the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place. For example, 45.0, 48.5, 57.7.

callers Table:
Column Name	Type
policy_holder_id	integer
case_id	varchar
call_category	varchar
call_date	timestamp
call_duration_secs	integer

==> My approach:
--Case calculation
WITH case_count AS (
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN call_category = 'n/a' OR call_category IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS unlabeled_cat_count
     , (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) FROM callers) AS total_case
FROM callers
)
--% of unalabelled cases of all cases
SELECT ROUND((unlabeled_cat_count*100.0)/ total_case, 1) AS uncategorised_call_pct
FROM case_count;
