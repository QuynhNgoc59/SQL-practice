Find the total number of downloads for paying and non-paying users by date. Include only records where non-paying customers have more downloads than paying customers. The output should be sorted by earliest date first and contain 3 columns date, non-paying downloads, paying downloads. Hint: In Oracle you should use "date" when referring to date column (reserved keyword).

==> My approach:
with download_count as (
select d.date 
     , sum(case when paying_customer = 'no' then downloads end) as non_paying	
     , sum(case when paying_customer = 'yes' then downloads end) as paying	
from ms_download_facts as d
join ms_user_dimension as m  
     on d.user_id = m.user_id 
join ms_acc_dimension as a 
     on m.acc_id = a.acc_id
group by d.date 
)
select *
from download_count
where non_paying > paying
order by date asc;
