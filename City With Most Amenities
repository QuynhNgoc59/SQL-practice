You're given a dataset of searches for properties on Airbnb. For simplicity, let's say that each search result (i.e., each row) represents a unique host. Find the city with the most amenities across all their host's properties. Output the name of the city.

==> My approach:
with cte as (
            select city
                 , LEN(amenities) - LEN(REPLACE(amenities, ',', '')) + 1 AS amenities_count
            from airbnb_search_details
            )
select top 1 city
from cte
order by amenities_count desc;
