You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	Type
item_count	integer
order_occurrences	integer

==> My approach:
--Order and item count 
WITH order_item_count as (
SELECT * 
     , (order_occurrences * item_count) AS num_item
     , (SELECT SUM(order_occurrences) FROM items_per_order) AS total_order
FROM items_per_order
)
--Mean calculation
SELECT CAST(SUM(num_item)/ MAX(total_order) AS DECIMAL(20,1)) AS mean
FROM order_item_count;
