Identify returning active users by finding users who made a second purchase within 7 days of any previous purchase. Output a list of these user_ids.

==> My approach:
--Previous order of each order 
WITH pre_purchase AS (
SELECT * 
     , LAG(created_at) OVER( PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at ) AS prev_order 
FROM amazon_transactions
)
--Users who made consecutive orders within 7 days
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM pre_purchase 
WHERE DATEDIFF(day, prev_order, created_at) <= 6;
