Table: Employee
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

==> My take on this problem:
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
         , DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM Employee)

SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN rank =2 THEN salary END) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM CTE
