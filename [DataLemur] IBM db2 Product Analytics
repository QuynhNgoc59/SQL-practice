==> My approach:
WITH query_count AS (
SELECT e.employee_id
     , COUNT(q.query_id) AS unique_queries
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN queries AS q
     ON e.employee_id = q.employee_id
        AND q.query_starttime >= '07/01/2023 00:00:00' 
        AND query_starttime < '10/01/2023 00:00:00'
GROUP BY e.employee_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id
)
SELECT unique_queries
     , COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM query_count
GROUP BY unique_queries;
