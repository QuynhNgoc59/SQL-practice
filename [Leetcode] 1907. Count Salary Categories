==> My approach:
WITH SalaryCategory AS (
    SELECT *
         , CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
            WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Average Salary'
            ELSE 'High Salary'
         END AS category
FROM Accounts
)
SELECT s.category
     , COUNT(a.account_id)  AS accounts_count 
FROM Accounts AS a 
LEFT JOIN SalaryCategory AS s
    ON a.account_id = s.account_id  
GROUP BY s.category;
