==> My approach:
WITH ProductCombination AS (
    SELECT p1.user_id
         , p1.product_id AS product1_id
         , p2.product_id AS product2_id
    FROM ProductPurchases AS p1 
    JOIN ProductPurchases AS p2
        ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id     
          AND p1.product_id < p2.product_id  
)
, CustomerCount AS (
    SELECT p3.product1_id 
         , p3.product2_id 
         , p4.category AS product1_category 
         , p5.category AS product2_category 
         , COUNT( DISTINCT p3.user_id) AS customer_count 
    FROM ProductCombination AS p3
    JOIN ProductInfo AS p4
        ON p3.product1_id = p4.product_id  
    JOIN ProductInfo AS p5
        ON p3.product2_id = p5.product_id  
    GROUP BY product1_id 
           , product2_id
           , p4.category
           , p5.category
)
SELECT *
FROM CustomerCount
WHERE customer_count >= 3
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
       , product1_id 
       , product2_id
