Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.
Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.
Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.

monthly_cards_issued Table:
Column Name	Type
issue_month	integer
issue_year	integer
card_name	string
issued_amount	integer

==> My approach:
--Issues order by card
WITH first_month AS (
SELECT card_name
     , issue_month	
     , issue_year
     , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY card_name ORDER BY issue_year, issue_month) AS issue_order
FROM monthly_cards_issued
)
--First issue month by card
SELECT f.card_name
     , issued_amount
FROM first_month AS f
JOIN monthly_cards_issued AS m 
ON f.card_name = m.card_name
   AND f.issue_month = m.issue_month
   AND f.issue_year = m.issue_year
WHERE issue_order = 1
ORDER BY issued_amount DESC;
