Zomato is a leading online food delivery service that connects users with various restaurants and cuisines, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, and get meals delivered to their doorsteps.
Recently, Zomato encountered an issue with their delivery system. Due to an error in the delivery driver instructions, each item's order was swapped with the item in the subsequent row. As a data analyst, you're asked to correct this swapping error and return the proper pairing of order ID and item.
If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it should remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.
In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs and items.

orders Schema:
column_name	type	description
order_id	integer	The ID of each Zomato order.
item	string	The name of the food item in each order.
orders Example Input:
Here's a sample of the initial incorrect data:

order_id	item
1	Chow Mein
2	Pizza
3	Pad Thai
4	Butter Chicken
5	Eggrolls
6	Burger
7	Tandoori Chicken

==> My approach:
SELECT CASE WHEN order_id = (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM orders) AND order_id % 2 = 1 THEN order_id
            WHEN order_id % 2 = 0 THEN order_id - 1
            WHEN order_id % 2 = 1 THEN order_id + 1
        END AS corrected_order_id
      , item
FROM orders 
ORDER BY corrected_order_id;
