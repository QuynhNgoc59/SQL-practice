Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. The output should display the month as a numerical value, product ID, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output first by month and then by product ID.
P.S. If you've read the Ace the Data Science Interview, and liked it, consider writing us a review?

reviews Table:
Column Name	Type
review_id	integer
user_id	integer
submit_date	datetime
product_id	integer
stars	integer (1-5)

==> My approach:
SELECT product_id
     , EXTRACT (month from submit_date) AS mth 
     , ROUND(AVG(stars), 2) AS avg_stars
FROM reviews
GROUP BY product_id
       , EXTRACT (month from submit_date)
ORDER BY mth
       , product_id;
