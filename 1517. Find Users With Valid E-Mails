Table: Users

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| mail          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information of the users signed up in a website. Some e-mails are invalid.
 
Write a solution to find the users who have valid emails.
A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where:
The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.
The domain is '@leetcode.com'.
Return the result table in any order.

==> My approach:
SELECT *
FROM Users
WHERE RIGHT(MAIL,13) = '@leetcode.com' 
      AND LEFT(MAIL,1) LIKE '[a-zA-Z]%' 
      AND LEFT(MAIL, LEN(MAIL) - 13) NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]%'
