Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").
Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

pages Table:
Column Name	Type
page_id	integer
page_name	varchar

page_likes Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
page_id	integer
liked_date	datetime

==> My approach:
SELECT p.page_id
FROM pages AS p 
LEFT JOIN page_likes AS pl 
ON p.page_id = pl.page_id
WHERE pl.page_id IS NULL
ORDER BY p.page_id DESC;
