You are given a table named airbnb_host_searches that contains data for rental property searches made by users. Determine the minimum, average, and maximum rental prices for each popularity-rating bucket. A popularity-rating bucket should be assigned to every record based on its number_of_reviews (see rules below).
The host’s popularity rating is defined as below:
•   0 reviews: "New"
•   1 to 5 reviews: "Rising"
•   6 to 15 reviews: "Trending Up"
•   16 to 40 reviews: "Popular"
•   More than 40 reviews: "Hot"
Output host popularity rating and their minimum, average and maximum rental prices. Order the solution by the minimum price.

==> My approach:
WITH rating_group as (
SELECT id 
     , price
     , CASE WHEN number_of_reviews = 0 THEN 'New'
            WHEN number_of_reviews BETWEEN 1 AND 5 THEN 'Rising'
            WHEN number_of_reviews BETWEEN 6 AND 15 THEN 'Trending Up'
            WHEN number_of_reviews BETWEEN 16 AND 40 THEN 'Popular'
            WHEN number_of_reviews > 40 THEN 'Hot'
        ELSE null 
        END AS host_popularity 
FROM airbnb_host_searches
)
SELECT host_popularity
     , MIN(price) AS min_price
     , AVG(price) AS avg_price
     , MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM rating_group
GROUP BY host_popularity
ORDER BY min_price;
