Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:
Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.
events Table:
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime

==> My approach:
--Impression & click count 
WITH calculation AS (
SELECT app_id
     , SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression_count
     , SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click_count
FROM events
WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2022
GROUP BY app_id
)
--% of click
SELECT app_id
     , ROUND((click_count*100.0/ impression_count), 2) AS ctr 
FROM calculation;
