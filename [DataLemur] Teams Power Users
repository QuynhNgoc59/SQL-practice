==> My approach:

WITH ranking AS (
SELECT sender_id
     , COUNT(message_id) AS message_count
     , DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT( message_id) DESC) AS mess_count_rank
FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM sent_date) = 2022
      AND EXTRACT (MONTH FROM sent_date) = 8
GROUP BY sender_id
)
SELECT sender_id
     , message_count
FROM ranking
WHERE mess_count_rank <= 2;
