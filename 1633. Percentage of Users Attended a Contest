Table: Users
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.

Table: Register
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.
Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

=> My approach:
WITH CTE AS(SELECT contest_id
         , (SELECT COUNT (user_id) FROM Users) AS Tota_user
         , COUNT(user_id)* 100.0 AS Total_register_user
FROM Register
GROUP BY contest_id)

SELECT contest_id
     , ROUND(Total_register_user/ Tota_user, 2) AS percentage
FROM CTE
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC
