The Bloomberg terminal is the go-to resource for financial professionals, offering convenient access to a wide array of financial datasets. As a Data Analyst at Bloomberg, you have access to historical data on stock performance.
Currently, you're analyzing the highest and lowest open prices for each FAANG stock by month over the years.
For each FAANG stock, display the ticker symbol, the month and year ('Mon-YYYY') with the corresponding highest and lowest open prices (refer to the Example Output format). Ensure that the results are sorted by ticker symbol.

stock_prices Schema:
Column Name	Type	Description
date	datetime	The specified date (mm/dd/yyyy) of the stock data.
ticker	varchar	The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL) for the corresponding company.
open	decimal	The opening price of the stock at the start of the trading day.
high	decimal	The highest price reached by the stock during the trading day.
low	decimal	The lowest price reached by the stock during the trading day.
close	decimal	The closing price of the stock at the end of the trading day.

==> My approach:
--Highest opening price by ticker 
WITH highest1 AS (
SELECT ticker
     , MAX(open) AS highest_open
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker
)
, highest2 AS (
SELECT h.ticker
     , h.highest_open
     , CONCAT(TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon'), '-', TO_CHAR(date, 'YYYY')) AS highest_mth 
FROM highest1 AS h 
JOIN stock_prices AS s 
ON h.ticker = s.ticker AND h.highest_open = s.open
)

, --Lowest opening price by ticker 
lowest1 AS (
SELECT ticker
     , MIN(open) AS lowest_open
FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker
)
, lowest2 AS (
SELECT l.ticker
     , l.lowest_open
     , CONCAT(TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon'), '-', TO_CHAR(date, 'YYYY')) AS lowest_mth
FROM lowest1 AS l
JOIN stock_prices AS s 
ON l.ticker = s.ticker AND l.lowest_open = s.open 
)
--Merge highest and lowest table 
SELECT h2.ticker
     , h2.highest_mth
     , h2.highest_open
     , l2.lowest_mth
     , l2.lowest_open
FROM highest2 AS h2 
JOIN lowest2 AS l2
ON h2.ticker = l2.ticker
ORDER BY h2.ticker;
