Table: Seat
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

==> My approach:
WITH CTE AS (SELECT id
                  , student
                  , LEAD(student) OVER(ORDER BY id) as next_student
                  , LAG(student) OVER(ORDER BY id) as pre_student
             FROM Seat)

SELECT id
     , CASE WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN pre_student
            WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id NOT IN (SELECT MAX(id) FROM CTE) THEN next_student
            ELSE student END AS student
FROM CTE
