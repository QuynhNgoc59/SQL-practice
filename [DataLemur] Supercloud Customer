A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is defined as a customer who has purchased at least one product from every product category listed in the products table.
Write a query that identifies the customer IDs of these Supercloud customers.

customer_contracts Table:
Column Name	Type
customer_id	integer
product_id	integer
amount	integer

products Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
product_category	string
product_name	string

==> My approach:
--Product categories count per customer
WITH cat_count AS(
SELECT customer_id
     , COUNT(DISTINCT product_category) AS prod_cat_count
     , (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category) FROM products) AS total_cat
FROM customer_contracts AS c
JOIN products AS p ON c.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
)
--Customers who have bought from all categories
SELECT customer_id
FROM cat_count
WHERE prod_cat_count = total_cat;
