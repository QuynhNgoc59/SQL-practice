==> My approach:
WITH product_cat AS 
(
  SELECT *
     , CASE WHEN price < 100 THEN 'Low Price'
            WHEN price > 100 AND price < 500 THEN 'Medium Price'
            ELSE 'High  Price'
       END AS category     
FROM products
)
SELECT category
     , COUNT(*) AS no_of_products
FROM product_cat
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY no_of_products DESC;
