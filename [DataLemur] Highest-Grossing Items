Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

product_spend Table:
Column Name	Type
category	string
product	string
user_id	integer
spend	decimal
transaction_date	timestamp

==> My approach:
--Ranks by category and product
WITH ranking AS (
SELECT category	
     , product
     , SUM(spend) AS total_spend
     , RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(spend) DESC) AS total_spend_rank
FROM product_spend
WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2022
GROUP BY category	
       , product
ORDER BY category	
       , product
       , total_spend_rank ASC 
       )
--Top 2 highest-grossing products within each category 
SELECT category
     , product
     , total_spend
FROM ranking
WHERE total_spend_rank IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY category
       , total_spend DESC;
