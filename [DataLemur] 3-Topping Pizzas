==> My approach:

WITH combination AS (
SELECT p1.topping_name AS name1
     , p1.ingredient_cost as cost1
     , p2.topping_name AS name2
     , p2.ingredient_cost as cost2
     , p3.topping_name AS name3
     , p3.ingredient_cost as cost3
FROM pizza_toppings AS p1 
JOIN pizza_toppings AS p2
  ON p2.topping_name > p1.topping_name 
JOIN pizza_toppings AS p3
  ON p3.topping_name > p2.topping_name 
  )
SELECT name1 || ',' || name2 || ',' || name3 AS pizza
     , cost1 + cost2 + cost3 AS total_cost
FROM combination
ORDER BY total_cost DESC, pizza;
