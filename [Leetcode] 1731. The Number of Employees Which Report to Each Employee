==> My approach:

WITH ReportCount AS (
    SELECT e2.reports_to AS employee_id 
         , e1.name
         , COUNT(DISTINCT e2.employee_id) AS reports_count 
    FROM Employees AS e1 
    JOIN Employees AS e2 
        ON e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to 
    GROUP BY e2.reports_to
           , e1.name
)
, AvgAge AS (
    SELECT reports_to  
         , ROUND(AVG(age*1.0), 0) AS average_age 
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY reports_to  
)
SELECT c.*
     , a.average_age
FROM ReportCount AS c
JOIN AvgAge AS a 
    ON c.employee_id = a.reports_to;
