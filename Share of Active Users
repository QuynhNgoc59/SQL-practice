Calculate the percentage of users who are both from the US and have an 'open' status, as indicated in the fb_active_users table.
Table: fb_active_users
user_id	name	status	country
33	Amanda Leon	open	Australia
27	Jessica Farrell	open	Luxembourg
18	Wanda Ramirez	open	USA
50	Samuel Miller	closed	Brazil

==> My approach:
with cte as (select country
                  , count(distinct user_id) as usa_user_count
                  , (select count (distinct user_id) from fb_active_users) as user_count 
             from fb_active_users
             where country = 'USA' 
                   and status = 'open'
             group by country)
select cast((usa_user_count/1.0)/user_count as decimal(20,12))*100 as us_active_share
from cte
