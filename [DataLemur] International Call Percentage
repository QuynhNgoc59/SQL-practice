A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.
What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.
Assumption:
The caller_id in phone_info table refers to both the caller and receiver.

phone_calls Table:
Column Name	Type
caller_id	integer
receiver_id	integer
call_time	timestamp

phone_info Table:
Column Name	Type
caller_id	integer
country_id	integer
network	integer
phone_number	string

==> My approach:
--Number of calls 
WITH call_count AS (
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pi1.country_id != pi2.country_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS international_call
     , (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM phone_calls) AS total_calls
FROM phone_calls AS pc 
JOIN phone_info AS pi1 ON pc.caller_id = pi1.caller_id
JOIN phone_info AS pi2 ON pc.receiver_id = pi2.caller_id
)
--% of international phone calls 
SELECT ROUND(international_call*100.0/ total_calls, 1) AS international_calls_pct
FROM call_count;
