The election is conducted in a city and everyone can vote for one or more candidates, or choose not to vote at all. Each person has 1 vote so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across these candidates. For example, if a person votes for 2 candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of 0.5 vote each. Some voters have chosen not to vote, which explains the blank entries in the dataset.
Find out who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the candidate or multiple names in case of a tie.
To avoid issues with a floating-point error you can round the number of votes received by a candidate to 3 decimal places.
Table 'voting_results':
voter	candidate
Kathy	
Charles	Ryan 
Charles	Christine 
Charles	Kathy 
Benjamin	Christine 
Anthony	Paul 
Anthony	Anthony 
Edward	Ryan 
Edward	Paul 
Edward	Kathy 

==> My approach:
with cte1 as (
            select voter
                 , count (distinct candidate) as candidate_count
            from voting_results
            group by voter 
            )
   , cte2 as (
            select *
                 , case when candidate_count > 1 then cast (1/ candidate_count as decimal(20, 3))
                        when candidate_count = 1 then 1
                        else 0
                        end as vote_count
            from cte1
            )
   , cte3 as (
            select cte2.voter, candidate_count, vote_count, candidate
            from cte2
            left join voting_results as vr on cte2.voter = vr.voter
             )
select top 1 candidate
from cte3
group by candidate
order by sum(vote_count) desc
