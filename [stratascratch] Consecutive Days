==> My approach:
WITH ConsecutiveDay AS (
SELECT *
     , LEAD(record_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY record_date) AS one_next_day
     , LEAD(record_date, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY record_date) AS two_next_day
FROM sf_events
)
SELECT user_id
FROM ConsecutiveDay
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, record_date, one_next_day) = 1
    AND DATEDIFF(DAY, one_next_day, two_next_day) = 1;
