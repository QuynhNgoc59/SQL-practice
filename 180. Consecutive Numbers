Table: Logs
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.

==> My approach:
WITH CTE AS (SELECT *
                  , LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS occur_2
                  , LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS occur_3
FROM Logs)

SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums 
FROM CTE 
WHERE num = occur_2 AND num = occur_3
