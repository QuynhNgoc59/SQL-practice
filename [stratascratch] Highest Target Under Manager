Identify the employee(s) working under manager manager_id=13 who have achieved the highest target. 
Return each such employeeâ€™s first name alongside the target value. 
The goal is to display the maximum target among all employees under manager_id=13 and show which employee(s) reached that top value.

==> My approach:
WITH target_ranking AS (
SELECT first_name
     , target
     , DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY target DESC) AS ranking
FROM salesforce_employees
WHERE manager_id = 13
)
SELECT first_name
     , target
FROM target_ranking
WHERE ranking = 1;
