Table: Weather
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order.

=> My approach:
SELECT W1.id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
ON W1.recordDate = DATEADD(day, 1, W2.recordDate)
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;
