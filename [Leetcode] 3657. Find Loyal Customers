==> My approach:
--Caclulate number of orders, date diff from first and last order, refund rate per customer
WITH ActiveDay AS (
    SELECT customer_id      
         , DATEDIFF(day, MIN(transaction_date), MAX(transaction_date )) AS active_days
         , COUNT(*) AS total_order
         , SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'refund' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100/ COUNT(*) AS refund_rate
    FROM customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
          AND DATEDIFF(day, MIN(transaction_date), MAX(transaction_date )) >= 30
          AND SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'refund' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100/ COUNT(*) < 20
)
SELECT customer_id
FROM ActiveDay
ORDER BY customer_id ;
