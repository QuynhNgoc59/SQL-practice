Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user. Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
spend	decimal
transaction_date	timestamp
transactions Example Input:
user_id	spend	transaction_date
111	100.50	01/08/2022 12:00:00
111	55.00	01/10/2022 12:00:00
121	36.00	01/18/2022 12:00:00
145	24.99	01/26/2022 12:00:00
111	89.60	02/05/2022 12:00:00

==> My approach:
--Transaction order by user
WITH trans_order AS (
SELECT user_id
     , spend
     , transaction_date
     , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS trans_order
FROM transactions 
)
--Third transaction of each user
SELECT user_id
     , spend
     , transaction_date
FROM trans_order
WHERE trans_order = 3;
