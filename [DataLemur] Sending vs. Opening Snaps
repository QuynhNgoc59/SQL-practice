Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.
Notes:
Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

activities Table
Column Name	Type
activity_id	integer
user_id	integer
activity_type	string ('send', 'open', 'chat')
time_spent	float
activity_date	datetime

age_breakdown Table
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
age_bucket	string ('21-25', '26-30', '31-25')

==> My approach:
--Spent time grouping
WITH spent_time_group AS (
SELECT ab.age_bucket
     , SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'send' THEN time_spent END) AS send_time
     , SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' THEN time_spent END) AS open_time
     , SUM(time_spent) FILTER(WHERE activity_type IN ('open', 'send')) AS total_spent_time
FROM activities AS a 
JOIN age_breakdown AS ab
ON a.user_id = ab.user_id
GROUP BY age_bucket
)
--Percentage calculation
SELECT age_bucket
     , ROUND((send_time/ total_spent_time)*100, 2) AS send_perc
     , ROUND((open_time/ total_spent_time)*100, 2) AS open_perc
FROM spent_time_group;
