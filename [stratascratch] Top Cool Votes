Find the review_text that received the highest number of  cool votes.
Output the business name along with the review text with the highest number of cool votes.

==> My approach:
WITH cool_vote_rank AS (
SELECT business_name
     , review_text
     , SUM(cool) AS cool_count
     , DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(cool) DESC) AS cool_rank
FROM yelp_reviews
GROUP BY business_name
       , review_text
)
SELECT business_name
     , review_text
FROM cool_vote_rank
WHERE cool_rank = 1;
